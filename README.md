# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Compilation of different ML algorithms implemented from scratch (and optimized extensively) for the courses COL774: Machine Learning (Spring 2020) & COL772: Natural Language Processing (Fall 2020). The directories present here correspond to a compilation of certain algorithms to solve some specific problems that woud be posed as assignments. These directories are presented with a detailed description, but briefly they can be summed up as follows:

1. **Lin-Log-GDA**: Consists of the Implementations for Linear-regression, Logistic-regression, and Gaussian-Discriminant-Analysis
2. **NB-SVM-Classification**: Consists of the Implementations for Naive-Bayes and Support-Vector-Machines
3. **Trees-Forests-Neurons**: Consists of the Implemenations of Decision-trees, Random-forests, and Neural-Architectures.
4. **IITD-Email-Classification**: Consists of a thoroughly engineered Test-categorization-system, that would serve as a potential candidate to be used for the Email classification system employed by IIT-Delhi. Was among one of the best performants in the class tournament.
